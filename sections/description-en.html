<p>This section shows an example of instantiating the AffectedBy ODP. Let us consider a problem that deals with ensuring the thermal comfort of a lecture room located in the ground floor of a building. This room has a large window that overlooks the road that passes near the building and some qualities of the room include its area, the number of seats available or the quality of comfort at any given time. The quality of comfort in this room is affected by the room temperature and the nearby outdoor noise. In turn, the temperature of the room is affected by the number of people present in the room, the humidity of the room, and the intensity of the solar radiation received through the room window. Regarding the impact of the outdoor noise, it is affected by the sound insulation factor of the room. Lastly, the received solar radiation is affected by the azimuth (i.e. orientation) of the room window. Figure 2 represents this example (for the sake of simplicity, the <i>rdf:type</i> relationships are not shown)</p>
